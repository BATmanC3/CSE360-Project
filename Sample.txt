“Software engineering is essential for the functioning of government, society, and national and
international businesses and institutions. We can’t run the modern world without software. National
infrastructures and utilities are controlled by computer-based systems, and most electrical products
include a computer and controlling software. Industrial manufacturing and distribution is completely
computerized, as is the financial system. Entertainment, including the music industry, computer
games, and film and television, is software-intensive. More than 75% of the world’s population have a
software-controlled mobile phone, and, by 2016, almost all of these will be Internet-enabled” -Ian
